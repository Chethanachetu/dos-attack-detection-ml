# DoS Attack Detection using Machine Learning

This project detects Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks using ML based classification models.  
It analyzes network traffic and classifies packets as *Normal* or *Attack*.

 ✅ Features
- Network traffic preprocessing
- ML-based classification (Random Forest)
- High accuracy detection
- Extensible for real-time IDS

 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn
- Jupyter Notebook

 📊 Dataset
NSL-KDD / Custom CSV sample included

 📦 Installation
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

 ▶️ Run
Open Notebook:
notebooks/DoS_Detection.ipynb

 📈 Result
- Accuracy: ~95%
- Correctly identifies DoS attacks

 📜 Future Scope
- Deep learning models
- Real-time IDS integration
- Dashboard & API
